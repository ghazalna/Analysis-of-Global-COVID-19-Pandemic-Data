# COVID-19 Global Testing Analysis

Welcome to the COVID-19 Global Testing Analysis repository! In this scenario, I will step into the role of a data analyst on a news channel's data science team. My task is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 testing data for an upcoming documentary feature.

## Project Overview

As part of the news channel's documentary team, My goal is to provide data-driven insights into global COVID-19 testing by country. Leveraging my R skills, I will webscrape a public wiki page to acquire a relevant dataset. The analysis will be performed using Jupyter Notebook.

## Lab Instructions

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook with tasks, sample code, and comments to guide you through the analysis process. The notebook covers various data analysis tasks, from web scraping the global COVID-19 dataset to conducting insightful analyses.

## Key Features

- **Webscraping:** Utilize web scraping techniques to acquire the global COVID-19 testing dataset.
- **Data Processing:** Clean and preprocess the data for meaningful analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
- **Visualizations:** Create informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
- **Jupyter Environment:** Access a browser-based Jupyter environment for seamless analysis.

## Contents

1. **Notebook:** The Jupyter notebook containing tasks, code, and comments for step-by-step analysis.
2. **Data:** Relevant datasets used in the analysis.
3. **Visualizations:** Output visualizations for easy reference and presentation.
